## I'm Ronan Burke aka Burkus. Hi there 👋

I am a developer with experience in mobile app dev, front-end web, back-end development, and cloud. The technologies I'm most familiar with are: Xamarin Forms, C#, .NET, TypeScript/JavaScript, Angular, Ionic, Java, and AWS.

I like to develop apps, websites, and games in my spare time.
